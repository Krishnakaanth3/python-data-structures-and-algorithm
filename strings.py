'''
apple = input ("Enter a string: ")
apple = int(apple)
x= apple - 10
print (x)

fun fact - 0 (ground floor of the building) is the lowest floor of the building in europe. So, technically they started using this principle for indexing an array from 0.
'''
fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[0]
print(letter)
#find length of a string using len() function
print(len(fruit))
#find last letter of a string
print(fruit[len(fruit)-1])
